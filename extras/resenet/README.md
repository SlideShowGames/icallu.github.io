<h1>What is ReSENET?</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ReSENET is the unoffical chrome extension port of Senet Online. For now this will only work on Chrome OS with Native client (NaCL) active since I do not have the client's source code. You could play this on other platforms if you downgrade chrome to under v112</p>
<p></p>
<p>Windows currently can be opened but not played. Linux can't downgrade chrome.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what will happen if you try to play on an unsupported version. (Latest version of Chromium on Linux)</p>

<p>And this is if you play on a supported version (Chrome 102 on MacOS)</p>
